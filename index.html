    <h2 class="me">About me</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Emanuel Tesfa and I am Computer
            Science student with aspirations to attain a Masters degree
            and embark in a career in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning </a>
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" target="_blank">Cloud Computing</a>
            A dream job of mine would be to work in North Charlotte at Red
            Hat.
        </p>
        <p>My family and I are originally from Eritrea, which is a small
            country on the East Coast of Africa. Since then, I've lived
            in Charleston, South Carolina and Jacksonville, Florida during
            my time in America.
        </p>
    <h2 class="hob">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>I am a man of many hobbies! Soccer was my first sport and played
            it most of my life. In middle school and high school I also played
            basketball and even had the opportunity to play at a Division 2
            school. That being said, my favorite hobby and activity is playing
            saxophone.
        </p>

        <p> I got accepted to major in jazz performance in a few schools and even a
            final audition at NYU! To this day, I still play semi-professionally in
            a group for money. I also play clarinet as well as flute for classical
            band. Now I've came to find things, such as project based computing, is
            something that I've came to enjoy. Just the idea of learning and building
            new things has became something that has propelled me in my major.
